## 🔁 DAILY BOREDOM-PROOF ROUTINE (PRINT THIS)

```
🟢 Code (45 min)
🟡 Write material–location–transformation (20 min)
🔵 Draw / diagram (15 min)
🟣 Explain aloud (10 min)
```

Switch **activity**, not **goal**.

---

# 🧠 FINAL CHECKPOINT (END OF WEEK 6)

You should be able to say calmly:

> “I built a production-style Python backend with authentication, transactional order processing, analytics APIs, and observability, focusing on correctness, reliability, and clear trade-offs.”

That sentence alone = **interview readiness**.
