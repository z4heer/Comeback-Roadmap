### 
Before starting my IT comeback preparation, I want to set up all essential tools in advance—such as GitHub, Markmap, and similar platforms—to make my learning, practice, memory retention, and confidence-building smooth and efficient.
> Please provide a complete, well-structured list of tools used in professional IT practice, along with scientifically backed learning, memory, rehearsal, and manifestation techniques, so I can prepare effectively without wasting time.

# 🧰 MASTER TOOLKIT FOR IT COMEBACK (ALL-IN-ONE)
---

## 1️⃣ CORE TECHNICAL PRACTICE TOOLS (Non-Negotiable)

These simulate **real workplace conditions**.

### 🔹 Code & Version Control

* **GitHub**
  Purpose:

  * Daily coding proof
  * Version control mindset
  * Interview credibility
    Usage:
  * One main repo (flagship project)
  * Small daily commits (even 5–10 lines)

* **Git**
  Purpose:

  * Professional discipline
  * Rollback & traceability

---

### 🔹 Development Environment

* **IntelliJ IDEA** (Java)
* **VS Code** (Python / general)

Purpose:

* Debugging confidence
* Faster thinking via shortcuts
* Industry realism

---

### 🔹 Databases

* **PostgreSQL** or MySQL
* **DBeaver**

Purpose:

* SQL muscle memory
* Performance thinking

---

## 2️⃣ THINKING & KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURING TOOLS

*(This is where senior professionals gain an edge)*

### 🔹 Visual Thinking

* **Markmap**
  Purpose:

  * Convert notes → visual maps
  * System flow clarity
  * Long-term memory anchoring

Use it for:

* Request → Controller → Service → DB flow
* Project architecture
* Interview answer maps

---

### 🔹 Knowledge Repository

* **Notion** or **Obsidian**

Purpose:

* One source of truth
* Interview Q&A storage
* Career gap explanation script

---

## 3️⃣ MEMORY, LEARNING & RECALL (SCIENCE-BASED)

These are **evidence-based**, not motivational fluff.

---

### 🔹 Active Recall

* Tool: Notebook + Voice
  Method:
* Read → close → write from memory
* Speak concept aloud without notes

Why it works:

* Forces brain to retrieve (strongest memory builder)

---

### 🔹 Spaced Repetition

* **Anki**

Use for:

* Java concepts
* Python syntax
* SQL queries
* Interview questions

Daily: 15–20 min only

---

### 🔹 Feynman Technique (Critical for Showcase Skill)

Tool:

* Mobile voice recorder

Process:

1. Explain topic as if to a junior
2. Notice gaps
3. Fix gaps
4. Re-explain simply

This directly fixes:
❌ “I know but can’t explain”

---

## 4️⃣ REHEARSAL & COMMUNICATION TOOLS

*(Your stated weak area — this will convert it into strength)*

### 🔹 Mirror + Mobile Camera

Purpose:

* Interview rehearsal
* Project explanation
* Career gap explanation

Practice scripts:

* “Explain your project in 2 minutes”
* “Explain a challenge you solved”
* “Explain your career break confidently”

---

### 🔹 Mock Interview Platforms (Optional)

* **Pramp**
* **Interviewing.io**

Use after Week 6 only.

---

## 5️⃣ MANIFESTATION & MENTAL CONDITIONING (GROUNDed, PRACTICAL)

This is **neuro-conditioning**, not superstition.

---

### 🔹 Identity Rehearsal (Daily – 5 min)

Notebook statement:

> “I am a calm, dependable senior developer who delivers working solutions.”

Why it works:

* Rewires self-image
* Reduces performance anxiety

---

### 🔹 Visualization (2–3 min)

Visualize:

* Sitting at desk
* Opening IDE
* Fixing bug
* Explaining solution calmly

This primes neural pathways before action.

---

### 🔹 End-of-Day Closure

Write 3 lines:

* What I learned
* What I built
* One thing done well

This prevents burnout and builds momentum.

---

## 6️⃣ TIME & DISCIPLINE TOOLS

* **Google Calendar**
* Simple paper to-do list

Rule:

> **Plan tomorrow today. No thinking in the morning.**

---
